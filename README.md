# Car Light System

This project discusses the implementation of the Exterior Light System (ELS) in a car using a Behavioural Driven Development (BDD) Approach. The basis of the project uses the ABZ
Case Study 2020. The project uses the Cucumber Framework for writing the gherkin scenarios with the aim of the workflow to split each individual requirement into scenarios, 
step definitions and the implementation of the requirement. The aim is to find issues in requirements such as conflicts as well hoping that the use of BDD can make ambiguous requirements
more clearer. By doing this we can help ensure that the implementation of requirements will not cause malfunctions due to misunderstandings caused.
